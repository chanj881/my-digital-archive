		<p>Finally setting up my 2025 journal and my first spread in years! I can't believe
			it's been so long. Winter break is slowly coming to an end.
			This year the break felt a lot shorter than the year before.
			And it was the first time flying back home on my own. It
			felt hard to leave home this time and I teared up saying
			bye to my parents. It seems like we made a lot of memories
			this break.

		<p>Last night (around 5pm?) it started snowing a lot.
			After the trip to Colorado, it feels like I'm
			not as excited to see snow but it was still fun to
			see snow regardless. Today, I went out to see the snow
			and also get some coffee at my favorite cafe.
			It's the last day of freedom before the spring
			semester starts tomorrow AHH!!
			I'm so worried about the cold weather this week,
			it's supposed to be -10 degrees Celcius. 
			And of course the first week of class is a 9AM.
			It seems like the winter weather still has a long way to go.
			Although I love winter, I can't wait till it gets
			warm again. Today I connected with a fellow graphic
			design student creator on Instagram. I built up the
			courage to leave a comment on their recent post
			and they ended up messaging me! We related a lot with
			each other and connected super quick. They seem like a sweet person.
			Almost feels like I'm in denial. I cannot believe the spring
			semester is now starting tomorrow. I feel like this year
			the winter break went by a lot faster, I hope my luck
			works again this semester and meet good professors and
			classmates! I'm also looking forward to learning new things and hopefully
			create a lot of projects that I am proud and passionate about!

				The first day of the 2025 Spring semester!
				Today I just had one class at 9AM, which was
				Core 2 Interaction. I'm quite worried for this 
				class since it's more coding. Did not get good sleep 
				last night because of the usual anxiety I get 
				before the first day of school. It was freezing
				today! Our professor seems very chill and nice while
				also being passionate about design (which is very important)
				I also might have bought a bunch of stickers, hehe!

			<p>Today was finally JEB reunion day after winter break.
				Super excited because JEB will have more time to
				see each other this semster.
				All JEB days always makes me feel so loved.
				E gave us our belated Christmas gifts which were
				the cutest keychains that were custom made for us.
				And B gifted me a huge Miffy plushie that she 
				got during her layover in Amsterdam.
				I felt so loved by JEB today and they know me 
				so well! We went to BLICK together (it was so cold)
				and we had a moment where EB helped with my scarf which was 
				such a cute moment. Day 2 of school and I'm already tired.
				Unexpectadly found out May and Gabby are in my lecture!
				And May convinced me to join their recitation class.
