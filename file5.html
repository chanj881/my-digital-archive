		<p>Justine... You are such an amazing and inspiring person. I am so so happy to be able to call you my friend!
			I don't know where I would be without you. You made my first year such a blast
			and I am so glad you are the J in our JEB! Love you so much.

		<p>Dear Jasmine, OH SHOOT I MEAN JUSTINE!!! It's fine,
			close enough, right? I love you so much. 
			You are truly one of my best friends and I don't know
			what I would do without you. I was able to feel comfortable
			with you almost instantly, which just goes to show how
			incredible your kindness, generosity, and supportive nature
			you are. These are just a few of the qualities I admire about you.
			And don't even get me started on your talent and work ethic!
			I'm forever grateful and appreciative of you. May all your
			wishes come true! Happy Birthday! Love, B.

			<p>Dear Soulmate, Very long overdue mail! What can I say, I'm broke
				and a master procrastinator whoops. Can you believe it's been
				3 months since we've seen eachother?? It feels like ages...
				I miss you soooo much, I look back at our pictures every
				day and often go through the journal you made. It still
				feels surreal. I'm always imaginging and planning
				a NYC trip in my head. I will make it happen!! So until then
				please wait for me!! I love you so much! I can't wait for the days
				we will see each other. As always, I'm here rooting for you.
				Miss you!
				Love, Your bestie
				</p>

			<p>	Hi Friend, First of all, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! (너 정말 늙었구나)!! But thank you
				for always being such a good friend to fall back on, 
				and to look up to. I'm for eternity grateful to find someone
				as KIND, BEAUTIFUL, THOUGHTFUL, FUNNY (and everything
				good thing in between) like YOU.
				I look forward to our future 4am-why-are-you-still-awake-chats,
				as well as all the crazy adventures. YOU are the best. 사랑해요! 
				No escape, all my love and wisdom.
