		<p>Today I finally met up with Linsi after 7 years. 
			As soulmates would, we both showed up with flowers for each other. 
			To my surprise, our first time meeting was much more comfortable than I imagined it would be. 
			I’m definitely looking forward to the many memories we will make together in the next few months in Korea. 
			But I started to feel very sick towards the end of the day, our trip to Busan starts tomorrow so I’m quite worried…

			<summary>From My Daughter</summary>
			<p>In the afternoon, I went on a movie date with Jinny. 
				We watched “Inside Out 2” together which was so good and I cried a lot. 
				Goodbye Jinny, have a safe trip back to the US! I’ll miss you!
				Later in the afternoon, we went to Jamsil baseball stadium to watch a game. The weather was so nice, not too hot and quite cool. We did not have any hits the entire game, until the last inning. Whew! Although we lost, that one hit really made us happy.
