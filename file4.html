			<p>Dear Yoonji, Hi Yoonji! I have so much to say before you
				leave, so I thought I should write you a letter.
				Although it was a short time, we became close really
				quick and we got to spend a lot of fun times together.
				I was sad we couldn't meet up as often as we wanted to.
				But of course, that means I will miss you even more. 
				Our conversations really clicked and we have similar interests
				so I really loved talking with you. When you're back in the US,
				I'll visit! Good luck with school and I'll also be trying my best.
				Let's meet again as more cool people.
				Love, June.				
				</p>
