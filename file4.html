			<p>In the afternoon, I went on a movie date with Jinny. 
				We watched “Inside Out 2” together which was so good and I cried a lot. 
				Goodbye Jinny, have a safe trip back to the US! I’ll miss you!
				Later in the afternoon, we went to Jamsil baseball stadium to watch a game. The weather was so nice, not too hot and quite cool. We did not have any hits the entire game, until the last inning. Whew! Although we lost, that one hit really made us happy.
