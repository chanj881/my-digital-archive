        <p>The power of the web is that it lasts forever and is never finished. This collection is a personal archive of valuables that I wish to keep forever. Words and text that live in paper, transferred to a digital world. With endless possibilities and no worries that it will vanish one day. 
            From precious memories to love filled letters. 
            Keep them forever and remember them forever. Recently, I noticed that I was losing a letter or a journal once in awhile. Maybe because I moved apartments, or I neglected them for too long. With "My Digital Archive" I hope to keep these valuable memories and words with me forever. Adding new files when I need to and never having to worry another memory will vanish.</p>
