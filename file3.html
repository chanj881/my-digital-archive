		<p>Dear Soulmate, I can't believe we already have to say bye...
			The past couple of months have been and felt unreal. And when
			I look back at all the memories we've made I still can't
			believe we got to spend time together. 
			I still remember feeling nervous and imagining what it
			would be like to see eachother in real life. But it just
			felt so natural. And that's how it felt like times after
			that too. I was always comfortale and really felt the
			happiest because we got to do our favorite things TOGETHER
			with each other. We spent my birthday together, celebrated
			our 7 years, got cute cakes and went stationery shopping.
			Even though it felt so normal for us. I still don't take
			any of it for granted and appreciate every single moment. 
			I'm so happy to take these memories home with me, and it feels
			like we unlocked a whole next level of friendship. I feel
			like we got even closer. Which I am so surprised is even
			possible. Thank you for showing me your favorite cafes,
			stationery stores, and BASEBALL. I hope the time we
			spent together was just as memorable and precious as it
			was for me. 
			I think, just like this time, our patience will get
			rewarded again. And we just have to wait a little to see
			each other. But I'm so glad to know it definetely won't
			be our last goodbye. Thank you for hearing me out, cheering
			for me, listening to my stories, and always being here for me.
			This time in real life. I appreciate you so much
			and now that we will both have to get back to real life again
			soon. Know that I will still always be here for you, supporting
			you and only wanting the best for you.
			P.S. I'm so sorry for this ugly paper haha. 
			I got you this Japanese postcard but only to find out it had
			no where to write on. Love you, your bestie. 
			</p>

			<p>"Manifest that shit!" This card is so unserious but fitting
				for us hahaha. I hope you like the gifts! I wish I could
				buy you every Miffy in the world but for now I thought
				this one would look cute in your new place. 
				When I saw the tulip cups I was like omg. I immediately
				got reminded of you and thought I have to get it. 
				I really pray they arrived safely without breaking.
				I got a set too so we are twinning as always.
