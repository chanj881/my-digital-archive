		<summary>May 23, 2024 Thursday</summary>
		<p>Today I finally met up with Linsi after 7 years. 
			As soulmates would, we both showed up with flowers for each other. 
			To my surprise, our first time meeting was much more comfortable than I imagined it would be. 
			I’m definitely looking forward to the many memories we will make together in the next few months in Korea. 
			But I started to feel very sick towards the end of the day, our trip to Busan starts tomorrow so I’m quite worried…

			<p>Linsi and I went to her first baseball game together, and this is our third day together. 
				I was worried about going to go see a game with someone who doesn’t know any rules of baseball, but to my surprise, she learned quickly and it seemed like she really enjoyed the game. I was quite proud of myself. We lost the game, it’s the 5th game in a row I saw that we lost.

			<p>Awesome Music Festival 2024 in Daegu
				Finally! I got to go see Day6 perform. 
				I went to the music festival on my own, so I was quite worried. But now all I want to do is go to music festivals and concerts on my own all the time. I literally had the time of my life and had so much fun. 
				The best festival I have ever been to. All the stages were so good and their live voices were the best. I appreciated how they really made sure we can hear the band's sounds clearly for the audience. There was even a firework performance for the encore song, which felt like a dream. I was jumping up and down and singing at the top of my lungs. Day6 songs helped me get through difficult times throughout my first year in school and living alone. It was so comforting and unreal to hear them live. My favorite songs from the festival:
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
					<li>Somehow</li>
					<li>Healer</li>
					<li>Sweet Chaos</li>
					<li>Congratulations</li>
					<li>Best Part</li>
				</ul>
				P.S. I almost didn’t make it to my train back, but I met the sweetest people to ride a taxi with. I will forever remember and be grateful for them.

			<summary>June 17, 2024 Seoul Forest</summary>
			<p>Today is Linsi’s birthday!
				The fact that we are spending a birthday together feels like a dream. 
				In celebration, we went to the hair salon together. I dyed my hair for the first time, and I dyed it a plum color. I’m so happy with the color and how it turned out. We went around Seoul Forest and Seongsu and spent another fun day together. I love you and happy birthday!

			<summary>June 20, 2024 Dduksum</summary>
			<p>Yesterday, we suddenly decided to go see Youngji busking at Dduksum. It was not planned, which makes it more fun. It was one of the hottest days in Seoul, but anything for Linsi to be happy. 
				After the busking, we had a picnic near the Hangang river. All the time I spend with Linsi feels so valuable and special. 
				Our bodies were literally sticky from the heat but I’m happy to say I made another core memory of my 20’s.

			<summary>June 25, 2024 Tuesday</summary>
			<p>In the afternoon, I went on a movie date with Jinny. 
				We watched “Inside Out 2” together which was so good and I cried a lot. 
				Goodbye Jinny, have a safe trip back to the US! I’ll miss you!
				Later in the afternoon, we went to Jamsil baseball stadium to watch a game. The weather was so nice, not too hot and quite cool. We did not have any hits the entire game, until the last inning. Whew! Although we lost, that one hit really made us happy.
