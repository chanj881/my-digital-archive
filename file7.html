			A note to myself…
			Dear Justine,
			Hey, it’s been lots of months since 2018-2019, 
			my first year of high school started. There have been 
			lots of stressful times but also there were lots of fun 
			and happy times. It felt so long but at the same time, it 
			all felt so short. I wonder how my first freshman year 
			passed by. This month (April) has been one of the craziest 
			months of my life. I started studying for my AP Final exam. 
			Lately I've been quite stressed with school work. Not being 
			stressed about the work, but simply being stressed with comparing 
			my grades with others. It seems that I work the hardest, 
			but it never pulls off. How come when I work hard nothing good 
			happens? How come others do so well without even trying? 
			I really worked so hard for Ap Psychology this year and I 
			really want to do well on the final. I’m trying hard and I’m 
			crossing my fingers that this time it will work out. This is 
			just a reminder to myself that grades don’t always matter. 
			Love, Justine ♡

		<h3>2020</h3>
		<div class="focus-content">
		  <p>Today is January 22, 2020 
			which is the last day of finals week! Which also means 
			it’s now the end of the semester! This semester had a few 
			hard times but it was also a really memorable semester. 
			I honestly learned so much about myself and that I need to 
			improve in terms of my learning and school. Which means I was 
			also able to improve my studying skills which makes me super 
			happy because it took me so long to finally find a technique 
			that works for me. I am now able to rest for 4 days and then it’s 
			back to school! I am honestly very scared and nervous for semester 
			two but there is nothing I can do about it. Like always, I am still 
			counting down the days until summer breaks. 138 days left!
			 I’ve been counting down since that said 300 days so it seems 
			 like a small number to me know. Know? No now haha. I love that 
			 I make so many mistakes in my journal but I don’t use white out 
			 because I’d rather laugh it out while writing it in my journal. Have fun and good luck in semester 2!

		<h3>2021</h3>
		<div class="focus-content">
		  <p>Today is February 22, 2021. First day of people going back to in-person school which 
			means classes now start at 7:15 AM for me. Obviously because 
			today is Day One it wasn’t too bad. Tomorrow I go to school for 
			the first time in 11 months to take the ACT. I did not study for 
			it, but I’m hoping it will show me where I am. School, art, and 
			work have been keeping me super buddy but now I also have tons of 
			kdramas to watch to keep me busy.
