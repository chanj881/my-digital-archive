		<summary>July 6, 2024 Jeju</summary>
		<p>In 2024, we went to Jeju again! Me + Mom + 이모
			We have so many precious memories in Jeju together, that we keep wanting to go back again every year. 
			The monsoon season started so we were worried about the weather, but luckily it didn’t rain while we were there. This is our last trip together in 2024, during the 3 days I felt so happy. We ate lots of good food, went swimming, and created more life-long memories.

			<p>Met up with Linsi again after less than 24 hours. 
				We went to a wine bar to enjoy dinner together at Dongdaemun. 
				Lots of good food, wine, sake, and even whiskey. We tried a lot of different drinks through the tastings, but we both didn’t get drunk. 
				After eating and drinking, of course we went shopping again at Dongdaemun for some accessories and skin care. I also got to pick up a gift for dad while I was shopping, we were out until midnight. 
				There’s only one day left with Linsi before she leaves… I’m already sad...

			<summary>July 31, 2024 Wednesday</summary>
			<p>The last day of July, and the last day with Linsi. 
				After being friends for 7 years, and spending 3 months together, we spent a lot of time together. We tried to meet as often as possible, since we don’t know when our “next time” will be, We created extremely happy memories together. All I can say is that Linsi is truly my soulmate and best friend. She’s a friend that matches my energy perfectly, I can completely show my comfortable sides, and she knows me too well. I don’t know if I could meet another person like her. 
				I believe that we can meet again faster than we imagined. Our goal is to see each other again in 2 years! We can make it happen. Long distance sucks, but we can always dream of our reunion. Since it is our last day together, we had to go to our favorite neighborhood, Mangwon. After looking around, we also went to Jamsil to watch another game. I’m going to miss you so much!

		<summary>August 5, 2024 Monday</summary>
		<p>I went on a solo date in Daegu and I did all the things I’ve always wanted to do:
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
				<li>Shopping at Shinsegae mall (Hello Kitty 50th Anniversary show)</li>
				<li>Watch a movie by myself</li>
				<li>Go to karaoke by myself (scored 99)</li>
			</ul>
			I wanted to do all the things I’ve always wanted to do alone, so Ifelt so accomplished by the end of the day. Sometimes, being alone really heals me and I somehow feel more confident afterwards. Daegu will definitely be one of my happy places, where it holds a lot of my memories.

			<summary>August 14, 2024 Seoul</summary>
			<p>Today is my last day in Seoul. Seeing the end in front of me made me cry in my sleep last night. During the 3 months I was here, it all felt like a dream and I made endless memories. 
				I felt so happy and since I know what it feels like to leave, it really hurts. I hope the day that I can come back will come faster than I imagine. 
				This made me feel the motivation to live life to the fullest and work very hard. On my last day, I went to the hair salon to dye my hair black. Finally living my black hair dreams. I love how it turned out and it definitely suits me the best. And the last day at Berci Cafe, please stay healthy!
